Here are some sample tests based on the above specification:

```python
import pytest
from game import Player, Area, Item, Quest

def test_move_player_success():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    area1 = Area("Area 1", "This is area 1.")
    area2 = Area("Area 2", "This is area 2.")
    area1.connect(area2, "north")
    assert player.move("north", area1) == True
    assert player.current_area == area2

def test_move_player_failure():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    area1 = Area("Area 1", "This is area 1.")
    area2 = Area("Area 2", "This is area 2.")
    assert player.move("north", area1) == False
    assert player.current_area == area1

def test_get_area_description():
    area = Area("Area", "This is an area.")
    assert area.get_description() == "This is an area."

def test_get_item_description():
    item = Item("Item", "This is an item.")
    assert item.get_description() == "This is an item."

def test_use_item_success():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    item = Item("Healing Potion", "This potion heals the player.")
    player.add_item(item)
    assert player.use_item(item) == True
    assert player.health == 110

def test_use_item_failure():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    item = Item("Healing Potion", "This potion heals the player.")
    assert player.use_item(item) == False
    assert player.health == 100

def test_start_quest_success():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    quest = Quest("Find the Lost Artifact", "Find the lost artifact in the forest.")
    assert player.start_quest(quest) == True
    assert quest in player.active_quests

def test_start_quest_failure():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    quest = Quest("Find the Lost Artifact", "Find the lost artifact in the forest.")
    player.start_quest(quest)
    assert player.start_quest(quest) == False
    assert quest in player.active_quests

def test_complete_quest_success():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    quest = Quest("Find the Lost Artifact", "Find the lost artifact in the forest.")
    player.start_quest(quest)
    assert player.complete_quest(quest) == True
    assert quest not in player.active_quests

def test_complete_quest_failure():
    player = Player("Test Player", 100, [])
    quest = Quest("Find the Lost Artifact", "Find the lost artifact in the forest.")
    assert player.complete_quest(quest) == False
    assert quest not in player.active_quests
``` 

Note that these tests are not exhaustive and more tests may be needed to fully test the game. Additionally, the implementation of the game classes and functions are not provided, so these tests may not run without errors until the implementation is completed.
