The player starts in the village of Eternia and must travel to different areas to find the Masters and complete quests to gain their trust and assistance in defeating Skeletor. The main quest is to retrieve the Sword of Power and use it to defeat Skeletor. The ten sub-quests involve tasks such as finding lost artifacts, rescuing prisoners, and defeating Skeletor's minions.\n\nTo run the game, the user should run the main.py file. The game will be controlled via keyboard input. The user will be presented with a description of their current area and a list of available actions. The user can then input a command to perform an action such as moving to a different area, using an item, or starting/completing a quest. The game will continue until the player completes the main quest or dies."}]
