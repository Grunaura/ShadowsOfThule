We are writing a text based adventure game called Masters of the Universe in python. The brave adventurer seeks the masters and goes on a quest with He-Man and the other Masters against the evil Skeletor and his forces.  The flavor will be similar to the filmation version of He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. The game should be three times as large as the average text based adventure game and be unparralelled in detail. MVC components split in separate files. Keyboard control. Please generate twenty areas the character can move to within this text based game. Create detailed documentation explaining how to run the game and about the story line. Create an engaging story for the adventurer to go on. Create a main quest. Create ten subquests.
